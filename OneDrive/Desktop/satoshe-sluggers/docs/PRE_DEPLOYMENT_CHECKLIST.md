## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **For Vercel** (User is handling)
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSIGHT_CLIENT_ID`
4. Deploy!

### **Vercel Environment Variables**
Go to: Project Settings → Environment Variables → Add:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID = [your_marketplace_client_id]
NEXT_PUBLIC_INSIGHT_CLIENT_ID = [your_insight_client_id]
```

**Optional** (if different from defaults):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_COLLECTION_ADDRESS = 0xE3f1694adCe46ffcF82D15dd88859147c72f7C5a

## ⚠️ **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**

1. **Temporary NFT Limit**: Currently set to 3,000 NFTs
   - To change: Update `MAX_NFTS` in `lib/contracts.ts`
   - When all 7,777 are uploaded, change to `TOTAL_COLLECTION_SIZE`

2. **Cloudflare Turnstile**: Not yet implemented
   - Phase 2 enhancement
   - User is setting up in parallel

3. **RPC Rate Limiting**: Set to 225 calls/second (buffer under 250 limit)
   - Monitor in production
   - May need adjustment based on traffic
